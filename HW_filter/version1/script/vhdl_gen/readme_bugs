there is a possible bug related to the binding function in this version.

In the v3 it has been hopefully fixed, but the check is still on the way.

BUG: the check for the binding is done on the next level, but also the actual level has to be checked
because if there are not enough elements to be compressed, there are not rooms for the compression
even if the next level will have more elements, due to the previous carries

UPDATE: the bug should have been fixed also for this version now, but it has not been tested yet
